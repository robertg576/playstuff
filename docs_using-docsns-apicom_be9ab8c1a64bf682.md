This API documentation is also a powerful tool allowing you to make API calls to a test server and your own netsapiens platform that is running v44.0+ with support for v2.

Getting started is as simple as configuring the server settings and establishing authentication. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Navigate to the "Base URL" section on the right side of the API Reference Page.
2. Click on the server name displayed in the "Base URL" value.

This action initiates the process of modifying the server name for your convenience.

With the server value successfully configured, proceed to set up authentication for secure access. While both API keys and access tokens (access\_token) can be utilized, API keys offer the simplest interaction with the documentation tool. However, note that access tokens do have a time-out feature.

1. Ensure you possess a valid Bearer token, either in the form of an access token or an API key.
2. Integrate the Bearer token into your authentication workflow for seamless connection.
