# Authentication Overview

_URL_: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/getting-started

> Source: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/getting-started

The NetSapiens API supports three types of authentication methods, each with its own set of benefits and considerations. These methods are detailed in the following guides:

1. [OAuth2 Based Access and Refresh Tokens](/docs/access-tokens)

   * Legacy format also supported by v1 applications.
   * Timed tokens suitable for various application types and scopes.
   * Requires a username and password to be granted an access token.
2. [JWT Tokens (JSON Web Tokens)](/docs/jwt-tokens)

   * Timed tokens with parseable token information.
   * Non-session-based, placing a lighter load on the system.
   * Particularly well-suited for end-user access to web applications.
3. [API Keys](/docs/api-keys)

   * Suitable for server-to-server applications where the API key can remain secure.
   * Ideal for applications requiring office manager, reseller, or super user access.
   * No username and password needed for authentication.
   * Can be restricted using read-only options and IP restrictions if required.
   * Usage is tracked and monitored through iNSight.

Each authentication method serves different use cases, providing flexibility and security based on your application's requirements.

# API Keys

_URL_: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/api-keys

> Source: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/api-keys

API Keys are a ideal method for Server to Server communication were the credentials can be kept secure and therefor can remain untimed. The ability to send a non challenged initial request for data provides a quicker response for data. API keys remain scoped as well so you can use API keys with most levels of authentication from Basic User up to Super User.

The API Key itself will be autogenerated on create and will not change. The keys will all be 60 characters long and consist of 3 parts described in some detail below. An example key looks like "nsu\_ylP7TGZvubv2x3eO5fbHrLaByniJelnL0FRbHYKnevTvqIfC5897f65c".

* **Prefix** (4 characters) - The prefix will help with readability and identifying that this is a "ns" (netsapiens) apikey as well as identifying the scope level in use to help a developer with expected restrictions.
  + "nss\_" - Super User
  + "nsr\_" - Reseller
  + "nsd\_" - Office Manager / Domain
  + "nsu\_" - Basic User / User
* **Random values** (48 characters) - The main and middle part of the key is all random hash generated in a crypto safe way.
* **CRC Check** (8 characters) - The last 8 characters are a CRC check of the first 52 characters. This adds to the length of the overall unknown random hash while also providing a way to validate if the key is formated correctly without checking a DB or running any more complex check function.

When using APIkey authentication you will need to provide the full length API key in the Authorization header with Bearer as well. This is very similar format to that of the Access Token and JWT token, though the API will be able to determine the correct logic to user based on the format or each type. An example full header implementation would be.

Header

```
Authorization: Bearer nsu_ylP7TGZvubv2x3eO5fbHrLaByniJelnL0FRbHYKnevTvqIfC5897f65c
```

The Key that is generated and send to the develop on create request or through the Admin UI is not stored in plane text in the DB. it is only shown to the developer/admin 1 time before its stored in a non reversible hash in the DB in a similar way a user's password is stored that makes it impossible to extract it and read it back. The recommendation for the key storage on the application side would be to store it securely as possible without it being shown out to the user or making it available in anything like a browser cookie, javascript code, or anything that can be extracted. It should be excluded from any of the version controlled software as well living only on the production servers or lab.

The Key ID is what is used to identify the key once its been created. It is created by using the first 12 characters of the full api key, but this is the only part that is stored in plane text. This id will be used for management of the key after its added as well as for logging including api logs and audit log.

APIkeys can be configured with a read only flag. This when set to yes will modify the scope permissions and leave only Read and Count actions as supported preventing the Create, Update and Delete.

Apikeys are not timed, but can easily be revoked cluster wide including a removal from cache on all servers with a simple api request to the revoke api. The only piece of data you need is the 12 character Key ID and authentication that allows you access to that ApiKey. That API is documented here, [Revoke Apikey](/reference/revokeapikey)

Usage can be tracked with iNSight pro by key ID. The metric is "api\_v2\_apikey\_requests" and will include the key Id as well as the instance (hostname) where the request are being made too.

This API documentation is also a powerful tool allowing you to make API calls to a test server and your own netsapiens platform that is running v44.0+ with support for v2.

Getting started is as simple as configuring the server settings and establishing authentication. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Navigate to the "Base URL" section on the right side of the API Reference Page.
2. Click on the server name displayed in the "Base URL" value.

This action initiates the process of modifying the server name for your convenience.

![Shows the edit process of the server name.](https://files.readme.io/07616d8-image.png)

Shows the edit process of the server name.

3. Complete the edit process, ensuring accurate representation of your desired server name.

![api.example.com shown as new server name.](https://files.readme.io/cff5ce2-image.png)

api.example.com shown as new server name.

With the server value successfully configured, proceed to set up authentication for secure access. While both API keys and access tokens (access\_token) can be utilized, API keys offer the simplest interaction with the documentation tool. However, note that access tokens do have a time-out feature.

1. Ensure you possess a valid Bearer token, either in the form of an access token or an API key.
2. Integrate the Bearer token into your authentication workflow for seamless connection.

![Set valid Bearer token either access_token or apikey](https://files.readme.io/ef93013-image.png)

Set valid Bearer token either access\_token or apikey

# v1 Migration to v2

_URL_: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/v1-migration-to-v2

> Source: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/v1-migration-to-v2

This guide covers the main differences when starting to use V2 (ns-api/v2) for those developers familiar with the v1 (/ns-api) api.

* The API no longer supports XML format; JSON is now the only supported format.
* List/read requests will be returned in array format even if there's only one result. Specific resource requests will be returned as objects.
* A 404 error will be returned for read, update, or delete requests if the requested resource is unavailable.
* Error responses will now be in valid JSON format, containing "code" and "message" fields, providing more detailed data instead of within headers.
* Success messages will consistently use JSON; for HTTP status 202, a "code" and "message" will be provided if applicable.
* Some POST APIs introduce a "synchronous" option, returning a 200 response instead of 202, along with a complete JSON representation of the created data. More info [here](/docs/async-202-vs-sync-200).
* The tilde character "~" can be used to represent "my" in various contexts. For instance, using it for {domain} or {user} in the path will automatically substitute it with valid data from the authentication token/key.

* When creating a domain using the V2 API, the "domain" user will also be created. All options for the domain user can be provided during domain creation and will be saved for the default user.
* By default, the V2 API creates a dial plan with the same name as the domain and establishes a dial rule to link to system defaults.
* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* Added ability to toggle recording on/off in the domain create/update
* Removed deprecated fields "rating" and "dial\_match".

* The V2 API now creates a default answer rule upon user creation and performs sim ringing across all devices.
* Handling of "dir" (now "directory-name-number-dtmf-mapping") is automated; manual setting is unnecessary.
* The term "subscriber" used in V1 has been deprecated in favor of "user."
* Field names have been changed and mapped to more descriptive names.
* New "site" is created if "site" given and that site doesn't exist previously.
* Added ability to toggle recording on/off in the User create/update

* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* Merged Timeframe's and Timerange's to allow for a single request with time ranges inlcuded in a multi level JSON request under time-range-data field.
* Better handling of default fields so not all options are needed.

* The answer rule system has been completely redesigned. For more details, refer to [this link](/reference/post_domains-domain-users-user-answerrules).
* Each feature now corresponds to an object with "enable" and "parameters" fields, incorporating time-frame information within the key.

* The call\_processing\_rules have been split into distinct fields, enhancing control.
* If not provided, the default SIP password will now consist of 16 characters.
* Previously concealed fields such as registration time, accept agent, and latency reporting values are now included.
* Added ability to toggle recording on/off in the device create/update
* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.

* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* The "reseller\_id" and "entry\_status" parameters have been deprecated/removed as they were unused.
* Improved validation during creation and deletion, rejecting operations if domains already exist.

* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* Added ability to toggle recording on/off in the callqueue create/update
* Enumeration values for "huntgroup\_option" (now "callqueue-dispatch-type") have been adjusted for improved representation and alignment with portal terminology. For more details, see [this link](/reference/post_domains-domain-callqueues).

* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* New Action APIs consolidate three API calls into one. Previously, separate calls were needed for agent update, agent log creation, and subscriber update to handle login or logout. These actions are now streamlined using the new paths: /login, /logout, or /{status}. For more details, refer to [this link](/reference/agentlogin).
* Enumeration values for "entry\_option" (now "callqueue-agent-availability-type") have been revised to better represent their meanings and align with Portal terminology.
* Enumeration values for "entry\_device" (now "callqueue-agent-has-registered-devices") have been updated for clearer representation. For more details, see [this link](/reference/post_domains-domain-callqueues).

* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* Phone numbers have been separated from the Dial rule object, with the new field "phonenumber" serving as the key. Fields such as "source" ,"valid range", "time of day" have been deprecated. If you need them then using Dialrule path would allow this from SU level.
* Enhanced duplicate protection has been implemented.
* Database structure has been optimized for faster lookup (DB read) speeds.
* Responder values have been aligned with new values. More info [here](/docs/application-mapping-in-phonenumbers-dialrules).

* Media and audio elements have transitioned from objects with filename keys to an array of objects.
* Field names have been updated and mapped to more descriptive names.
* URL encoding has been improved to handle '&' characters more effectively.
* Built in support for TTS for MOH, Mesg and Greetings. Will parse UI configs for language defaults or access params.
* Move to support new audio via 3 formats. TTS, Base64 encoded in JSON and form based File Upload to maximize supportability in different languages.

# Async (202) vs. Sync (200)

_URL_: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/async-202-vs-sync-200

> Source: https://docs.ns-api.com/docs/async-202-vs-sync-200

The netsapiens api by default will submit requests to its service bus for replication to all nodes/servers for saving to the DB's and applying to the real time memory for immediate use in the application. For most writes (Creates/POST, Updates/PUT, Deletes/DELETE) the success response code will be 202, meaning Accepted. This success message should be treated as a full success with an immediate ability to use the new resources.

In the cases where you want to get the full resource data including any defaults that might have been applied from the system you can request a Synchronous request where a 200ok will be retuned instead of a 202 with a full JSON response in the same format as a Read/GET of that specific item. The Synchronous requests are only available today on Creates (POSTs) and on certain APIs listed below.

* Resellers
* Domains
* Users
* Devices
* Callqueues
* Agents
* Answerrules
* Contacts
* Dialrules
* Audio (Moh/Greeting) upload/tts
* Timeframes
* Event Subscriptions
* Calls - Click to Call requests
